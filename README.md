# Selenium JavaScript Project with Chai and Mocha

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use Selenium WebDriver in JavaScript with Chai for assertions and Mocha as the test framework.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- Chrome browser (https://www.google.com/chrome/) or other WebDriver-compatible browser

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/jomarnavarro/SelJS.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```shell
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

4. Download the appropriate WebDriver executable for your browser:

* [Chrome WebDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
* [Firefox WebDriver (GeckoDriver)](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

Update the test files in the src/tests directory with your own test cases.

## Run the tests using Mocha:
